Expansions in  Bash

1. Tilde Expansion 
a)  The tilde expansion is used to represent a userâ€™s home directory.
b)  We can use tilde + plus  ~+ to represent the PWD and  tilde + dash ~- to represent the OLDPWD
2. Brace Expansion
a)  Brace expansion {} lets us substitute elements from a list of values separated by commas, or ranges of numbers or letters separated by two periods.
b)  Brace expansion is commonly used to preserve part of a path but replace a small portion of it.
c)  We can use it to present a set of values to use in the same part of a string.
d)  We can also use brace expansion to create a sequence of numbers or letters.
e)  We can also add intervals to sequences with a third argument in our brace expansion.
